Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of a responsive navigation bar that includes a logo, search bar,
login button, menu items, and a cart icon, closely resembling the layout used by Flipkart.

HTML Structure
The HTML structure is organized as follows:

The <header> element represents the header of the webpage.
Inside the <header>, there is a <nav> element containing an unordered list (<ul>) of navigation items (<li>).
The logo is displayed using an <img> element with the id "logo."
The search bar consists of an <input> element with a placeholder for searching.
The "Login" button is created with an <input> element of type "submit."
Other menu items are listed as text inside <li> elements.
The cart icon is displayed using an <img> element with the id "cart."
CSS Styling
The CSS properties used for styling the HTML structure are as follows:

margin: 0; padding: 0; box-sizing: border-box;: This CSS rule resets margin and padding to zero and sets the box-sizing 
property to "border-box" for consistent box model behavior.

header: Sets the background color of the header to #047BD5, which is a shade of blue.

nav #logo: Styles the logo image by specifying its width, height, and vertical alignment.

li: Removes the default list styling for list items.

nav: Styles the navigation bar with specific width, height, margin, text color, font size, and font weight.

nav>ul: Configures the layout of the unordered list within the navigation bar, using flexbox for spacing and alignment.

input[type="text"]: Styles the search input field with a specific width, height, and negative margin to adjust its position.

input[type="submit"]: Styles the "Login" button with specific width, height, color, font size, and font weight.

#cart: Styles the cart icon by specifying its width, height, and vertical alignment.

.head: Styles the main content of the header, setting its background color, display properties, and alignment.

.item img: Styles the images within menu items, specifying their width and height.

.item: Styles each menu item with text alignment and font weight.

#arrow: Styles the down arrow icon used in some menu items by specifying its width, height, and vertical alignment.
